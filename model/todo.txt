DONE -- implement usn-router-module.h
    - it will cointain the funciond like: send UP, DOWN, etc... por exemplo usando
      ormask, UP | LEFT... ALL...
    - this would be aslo responsible of forwarding packets and creating connections
      without the ack of the upper layers

DONE -- implement the usn-address-module.h
    - would cointain a different addressing mechanism, since the MAC does not have
      to be unique.

-- 16/04/14  - Replace the print data functions to callbacks, so the example software keeps
               track of the statistics, but not the node itself.
