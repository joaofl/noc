N3-3 module for mesh grid dense sensor networks and network-on-chip like network architectures.

It integrates with computational fluid dynamics to provide spatial and temporal data to the sensors in the network. We implement post-processing tools for packet and flow tracing, statistical survey and qualitative analysis of the sensed and processed data.

To set it up, place the module inside the **src** dir of ns-3, install lib-armadillo, configure ns-3 and build it. Check the input parameters to run the example.
Tested in version 3.18 of ns-3. Helpers and Testers not implemented yet.
